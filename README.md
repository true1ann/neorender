# NeoRender's EOS
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> NeoRender is now obsolete because of the fact that i cant maintain or add any new features, and the goal 'to break nothing with each update'. This repo wont directly have a link to the alternative i am already developing/developed (because NeoRender is archived BEFORE the creation of the new alternative) so check my GitHub Profile, @true1ann. No more updates will be released to this repository. Thank you to all of you who used NeoRender

# NeoRender
> The better CSR.  
- ðŸš€ Easy to learn, modern API
- âŒš No compilation, but fast loading
- ðŸ“¦ Dependency-less, just fetch & go!
- ðŸª¶ Lightweight
- ðŸ”‘ Made with purely TypeScript (Except Developer environment)

> [!WARNING]  
> As of right now, `.md` files and NeoRender in general is in a raw state, but i will make NeoRender better each update.
